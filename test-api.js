  valid: `Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include speech recognition, learning, planning, and problem solving. AI has been used in various applications such as virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and game playing. The field of AI research was founded on the assumption that human intelligence can be precisely described and simulated by machines. This assumption has led to significant advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. Today, AI technologies are becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives, from smartphone apps to smart home devices.`,
  
  long: `Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters. Climate change affects everyone, but the poorest and most vulnerable people are being hit hardest. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense, sea levels are rising, and the Arctic is warming. These changes are affecting food production, water availability, and human health. The good news is that we can still limit climate change if we act now. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect and restore forests, and invest in renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.`
